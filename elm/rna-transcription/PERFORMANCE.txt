Performance tests with long DNA input sequence

2541ms - v1
1618ms - v2 => Reducing to a single pass does improve performance :)
1441ms - v3 => 10% improvement from refactor.
                    v3 statically assigns err to Nothing on each iteration
                    v2 recalculates this "Nothing" every time, from "Just (Maybe.withDefault c err)"
1665ms - v2 with error, same as passing case
1103ms - v3 with error, 25% faster than v3 passing case
1414ms - v4 passing => same as v3. Compiled JS has tail call optimisation :)
 950ms - v4 with error => custom termination case instead of standard foldl is the best way to bail early
